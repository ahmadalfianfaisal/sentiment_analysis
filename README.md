# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

## Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Amazon product reviews using traditional machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes noise (e.g., HTML tags, punctuation), and standardizes text.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the distribution of word counts, scores, and sentiment categories.
- **WordClouds**: Generates WordClouds to visualize common terms for both positive and negative sentiments.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree for sentiment classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
Below are the dependencies required to run the project:

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
wordcloud
scikit-learn
```

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset contains Amazon product reviews with fields:
- `Text`: The review content.
- `Score`: The review rating (1 to 5).
- `Sentiment`: Derived from the score (Positive for 4-5, Negative for 1-3).
- `word_count`: The number of words in the review.

## File Structure
- `amazon_product_reviews.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `preprocessed_data.csv`: Output of the cleaned and preprocessed dataset (generated by the notebook).

## Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook amazon_product_reviews.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations:
- **Score Distribution**: Displays the imbalance and balanced datasets.
- **WordClouds**: Highlights common terms in positive and negative reviews.
- **Histograms and Box Plots**: Illustrates the word count distribution across sentiments.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Expand contractions (e.g., `can't` → `cannot`).
   - Remove punctuation and special characters.
   - Handle negations (e.g., `not good` → `not_good`).
2. **Tokenization and Stopword Removal**:
   - Split text into tokens and remove stopwords.
3. **Lemmatization**:
   - Normalize tokens to their base forms (e.g., `running` → `run`).
4. **Final Output**:
   - Saves the cleaned dataset as `preprocessed_data.csv`.

## Model Implementation
- **Models Used**:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- **Training and Testing**:
  - The data is split into training (79,2%), validation (19,8%), and testing (1%) sets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - GridSearchCV is used for optimizing hyperparameters.
